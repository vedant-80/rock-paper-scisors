# Rock Paper Scissors Project

Practicing Basic JavaScript for the Odin Project.

## Description

This game simulates the classic rock, paper, scissors game in 5 rounds and then automatically resets.  

## Features to change

The code could be refactored more succinctly. Instead of having 3 different message functions to display the results of each round, it could have only one with an additional parameter that decides the message. Additionally, some elements use the 'delete last node' function, which could affect the website if different elements were to be added and the order changed. Instead I could have delegated classes for these elements and deleted based of class name.
